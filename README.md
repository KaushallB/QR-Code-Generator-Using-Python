# QR-Code-Generator-Using-Python

I came up with this idea to create a QR code generator because QR codes are extremely useful in everyday life whether for sharing website links, Wi-Fi credentials, contact information, or plain text. My goal was to design a tool that is both practical and easy to use, allowing anyone to generate custom QR codes offline and keep them organized for quick access.
